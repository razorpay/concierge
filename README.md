# Concierge-Ingress

It allows us to create leases for incoming connections to Kubernetes Ingress Objects.

## How It Works

It uses **Kubernetes client go** package (Go) to access and make changes in the k8s objects.

## How To Use

1. Any developer having an organization email and login to Ingress-concierge.

2. Homepage have the list of all the ingress from which we can take the lease and it looks like the image added below
    ![Home page](./doc-images/homepage.png)

3. For getting lease to a particular ingress, click on the name of the ingress from the above ingress list shown and you will be forwarded to the page shown below:
    ![Ingress Details](./doc-images/ingress-details.png)

4. Now select the expiry time for the lease and click on "Access" button.

5. You will get a lease and you can't take the lease again if you already have the active lease.

6. You can also terminate the lease or it will automatically get terminated after its expiry time.
